## Description
Eventsim is a fake streaming service (think of Spotify). It can be used to generate stream events by random users. This project was setup to consume the streaming data being generated by Eventsim. The events are published to Apache Kafka and Apache Spark consumes and processes the data from the Kafka topics. The processed data are then stored in a data lake (GCS) in parquet files. Apache airflow is then used to orchestrate the workflow of writing the files in the data lake to the data warehouse (BigQuery). Google datastudio is then used to visualize metrics from the Dataset
